\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

\noindent  Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome typically associated with high prevalence, high mortality, frequent hospitalization and overall reduced quality of life (QoL). Approximately 65 million people are effected by HF globally \citep{hay2017global}. With an aging population it is expected that the prevalence of HF is to increase. In the developed countries, about 3-5\% of hospital admissions are linked with HF, accounting for about 2\% of the total health cost \citep{tripoliti2017heart}. It is not unusual for HF to be characterized as a global pandemic with prognosis being worse than that of most cancers, see \cite{braunwald2015war} and \cite{savarese2017global}.\\
\indent In terms of clinical classification, there is no single "universally agreed upon" system for classifying the causes of HF. Typically, HF manifests it self at least as two major subtypes \citep{alonso2015exploring}. Both being commonly distinguished based on measures of the left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). The first subtype encompasses patients with LVEF values larger or equal to 50\%. These patients are characterized as patients with HE with preserved ejection fraction (HEpEF). The second subtype includes patients with LVEF values less than 40\%, and these are characterized as patients with HE with reduced ejection fraction (HErEF). There is however a third subtype which are the patients belonging to the so called "gray zone" or the "the middle child", namely when the LVEF values lies between 40\% and 49\%\footnote{The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) were the first to define HF with borderline ejection fraction as being patients with LVEF values between \textbf{41\%} to 49\%, see \cite{yancy2013}.}. According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) these patients are defined as having HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), see \cite{lam2014middle} and \cite{ponikowski20162016}. Clinically clustering patients according to HF subtypes and identifying HF patients most at risk of mortality and readmission is something that remains challenging. Especially considering that the 1-year mortality rates for acute HF across different regions in Europa ranges from 21.6\% to 36.5\% (35.1\% - 37.5\% in the US), see. \cite{cheng2014outcomes}, \cite{inamdar2016heart} and \cite{crespo2016european}. Furthermore, patients with HFmrEF for example have a clinical profile and prognosis that is close to those of HFpEF. All of which makes the overall job of identifying and distinguishing these patients that much more challenging \citep{hsu2017heart}. It is also not known if improving phenotypic classification is clinically useful or even possible.\\
\indent Nonetheless, the rapid increase in available medical data on patients has lead to machine learning (ML) techniques gaining widespread attention by researchers. The application of such techniques is one that \textit{may} offer an opportunity to build better management strategies, as well as early detection and better prediction of adverse effects associated with HF. Of the ML techniques gaining most attention one typically finds \textit{clustering} and \textit{classification} methods being intensely studied. Accordingly, the use of ML techniques for identifying patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF most at risk of mortality and readmission is one we try to examine to it full potential.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:prob_stat}

\noindent In this thesis we investigate how well various clustering methods (K-means, Hierarchical, Gaussian Mixture and DBSCAN) perform in producing phenotypically distinct clinical patient groups with HFpEF and HFmrEF using phenomapping? Furthermore, we also evaluate the performance of various classification algorithms in predicting the clinical outcomes (mortality and hospitalization) of patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF. To answer these questions, we compare clustering groups and evaluate the forecasting accuracy based on various statistical properties in order to rank methods accordingly. All the models and techniques are applied on a data set consisting of 315 patients with symptomatic HF identified at a tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom.  

\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:thesis_struc}

\noindent The thesis is divided into five chapters and proceeds as following. The next chapter (\ref{chap:back}) reviews the literature on the application of ML techniques for the assessment of heart failure. This is done to put the proposed research in a relevant context. Chapter (\ref{chap:method}) details the methodology, including presenting the data and the quality of the data. Preliminary analysis on the data will also be done in this chapter. This includes evaluating and selecting a data set based on methods of imputation and dimensionality reduction. Next, chapter (\ref{chap:exp}) presents the results of the clustering comparisons with the prediction accuracy of the clinical outcomes, with conclusive remarks and discussion found in chapter (\ref{chap:conc}). The source code and relevant statistical output can be found in the appendix
