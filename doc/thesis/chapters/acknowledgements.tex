\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

\noindent Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors, Ulf Geir Indahl and Kristin Tøndel, for helpful guidance throughout the process of writing my thesis. They have always been available to answer my questions and their many comments and suggestions have certainly been of great help. They have shown great patience and for that I am truly thankful.\\

\noindent I would also like to thank my family for the support which they have shown over the years. They have laid a sound base for me when it comes to working with this thesis. I would especially like to thank my sister for proofreading and good advice.\\

\noindent Lastly, I would like to thank all my friends from the university for making studying for this degree a memorable experience. \\

\noindent All errors or ambiguities are solely my responsibility.\\
