\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:method}

\noindent In this chapter we present the methodology and research structure used in this thesis. Some pre-processing of data including imputation and dimensional reduction will also be explained and presented. The implementation of the ML algorithms that produce the results presented in chapter (\ref{chap:exp}) are also mentioned, with the source code being found in appendix (\ref{chap:souce_code}). 

\section{Overview}

\noindent As stated in the chapter (\ref{chap:intro}), the aim of this thesis is split into two parts. The first part being that of seeing how well various clustering methods perform in producing phenotypically distinct clinical patient groups with HFpEF and HFmrEF? We frame the SL problem in the setting of unsupervised learning and accordingly use the clustering methods: hierarchical clustering, expectation-maximization and latent class analysis to evaluate which produce the most clinically useful patient groups. The use of these clustering methods are commonly used in the literature (see section \ref{subsec:unsupervisedlearn}) and serves as the main motivation for including them in our analysis. The second part of the problem statement is to evaluate the accuracy of various classification algorithms in predicting the mortality and re-admission of patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF? In accordance with the literature as presented in section (\ref{sec:predclincout}), we reduce the SL problem of predicting the mortality and re-admission into a two class classification problem where both classes of outcomes are whether or not mortality/re-admission occurred. \input{doc/thesis/images/Research_structure.tex}\noindent The classification methods that we will be evaluating are: k-nearest neighbours (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms. All the algorithms are much used in the literature. The motivation behind all the chosen algorithms has always been to confirm with the practices in the literature. We do however need to emphasize that many algorithms exists that can be further used to broaden the analysis done in this thesis.\\
\indent The structure of the ML procedure adopted in this thesis starts by pre-processing the data. This includes imputation of missing data to ensure that the data is balanced and dimensional reduction to address eventual problems with higher dimensional multi-correlated variables. Both the pre-processing steps are explained in further detail later in this chapter (see section \ref{sec:data}).
