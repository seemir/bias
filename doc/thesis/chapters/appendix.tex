\noindent The following appendix presents all the relevant \texttt{R}-code used in this thesis. We have organized the chapter in accordance with the various steps in the machine learning procedure adopted in this thesis, see figure (\ref{fig:ML_proc_thesis}). We have tried to comment as much of the source code in order to ensure that an eventual re-examination of the results can be as easy and smooth as possible. Inquires about the code can be forwarded to the author on request.
